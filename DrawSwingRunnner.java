   ******** Project Description ********
   * 
   * My program is for generating shape art on a panel. You can add four different shapes (square, circle, triangle, rectangle), 
   * you have three size options for the shapes (small, medium, large), and you can either have a filled solid shape or 
   * a hollow outline of the shape. The specific kind of shape you want to use can be chosen with the correctly labeled
   * button, which adds that specific shape to the panel. Once a shape is added, you can use the keyboard spacebar
   * to change its colour and you can use the up, down, left, right keyboard keys to move it around. Colour change and 
   * position change is only for the most recently added shape (eg, if you added a square, you can change its colour and 
   * position. If you then add a triangle, only the triangle will now be able to move and change colour and not the square 
   * anymore). Lastly, to clear the panel and clear your existing art/start a new peice of art, press the "Clear Panel" button.
